    <h2>Packed with flavour⁠</h2>
    <p>this fajita is vegan friendly, using our Organic Banana Blossom to create a juicy filling!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Banana Blossom (soak in marinade overnight or for at least 3h)</li>
      <li>1 can Organic Banana Blossom</li>
      <li>1 can Organic Coconut Milk</li>
      <li>1 tsp Organic Ground Coriander</li>
      <li>2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
      <li>¼ tsp garlic powder</li>
      <li>¼ tsp Organic Cayenne Pepper</li>
      <li>¼ tsp Organic Turmeric Powder</li>
      <li>1 tbsp Organic Tamari Soy Sauce</li>
      <li>1 tsp Organic Maple Syrup</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>To serve, pick the coriander leaves off their stalks and sprinkle them all over and finish with a spoonful of vegan yoghurt.</li>
      <li>Drain and rinse banana blossom, next shred with your hands, then cut banana blossom into small pieces until a flakey texture remains.</li>
      <li>In a large container, combine all banana blossom ingredients, stir until the banana blossom is well coated and spices are mixed. Store in the fridge for 3-4 hours or overnight.</li>
      <li>In a small saucepan, cook ½ cup of basmati rice accordingly to the packaging instructions.</li>
      <li>Next prepare the green goodness dressing by adding all ingredients into a high-speed blender and blend until smooth. The dressing should be creamy and thick, add more water if you have troubles blending the ingredients. Pour green goodness dressing into an airtight container and store in the fridge, whilst preparing the remaining ingredients.</li>
      <li>Shred cabbage into very thin slices, season with lime juice, salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>In a small bowl, combine diced cocktail tomatoes, red onion and coriander. Toss in olive oil, salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>In a large pan, add banana blossom including the marinade. Cook over slow to medium heat for 10-15 mins or until almost no liquid remains, stir continuously. The banana blossom should now have a meat-like texture, which is similar to beef. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Finally drain black beans. In a small pan, heat 1 tbsp of olive oil. Once hot add beans and spices. Cook for 3-4 mins or until warm.</li>
      <li>Assemble and roll burritos: Spread 3 tbsp of the green goodness sauce across the bottom third of the tortilla. Next top with 3-4 tbsp of rice, 3 tbsp of beans, 2 tbsp of banana blossom, 2 tbsp of pico de gallo and some cabbage. To fold the burrito, fold the shorter left and right sides towards the filling. Next fold the bottom of the tortilla up and over the filling. Roll until the burrito is closed.</li>
      <li>You can also wrap the tortilla in aluminum foil and place it into a toaster press if you prefer it a little hotter and crispier.</li>
    </ol>
