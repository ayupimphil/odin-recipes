    <h2>A fiery chilli to warm your belly</h2>
    <p>This easy vegan chilli recipe makes for a quick and hearty meal, with key ingredients coming from the store cupboard in the form of tinned tomatoes and beans. I cook a big batch of this a couple of times a month and use it for lunches throughout the week.
    <p>For a hit of rich umami flavour, stir in a dollop of Marmite or other yeast extract. It's also good to add a splash of red wine vinegar or Henderson’s Relish (Sheffield’s vegan equivalent of Worcestershire sauce, but better). If you like coriander, add the chopped stems with a couple of minutes to go.</p>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Coconut oil</li>
      <li>1 x onion</li>
      <li>4 x garlic cloves</li>
      <li>2 x red chillies</li>
      <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat a little coconut oil in a large saucepan on a medium heat. While the oil heats up, peel and slice the onion then fry for 8 minutes.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile peel and dice the garlic and finely chop the chilli. Then add both to the pan along with the spices and fry for 1 minute.</li>
      <li>To serve, pick the coriander leaves off their stalks and sprinkle them all over and finish with a spoonful of vegan yoghurt.</li>
    </ol>
